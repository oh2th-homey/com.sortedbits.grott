# Grott

Adds support for [Grott MQTT topics](https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott) to Homey.

Currently there are a bunch of limitations:

- Only able to use `MQTT`, websockets are not supported
- Only 4 fields are exposed at the moment.
    - Current output
    - Average voltage over all phases
    - Energy total
    - Energy today
- Not ready to publish to the Homey App store yet

I am currently not using any more fields, but always open for suggestions.
